/** FLEXBOX
 * Section - Alignment
 * * 1. What's the difference between justify-content and align-items?
 * * * Justify-content aligns items along the primary axis, in normal flex direction it align's items horizontally and in flex-direction column it aligns vertically
 Align-items does the opposite, vertical for normal flex direction and horizontal for column direction
 * * 2. How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex container?
 * * * If the div is aligning itself: align-self: center; justify-self: center. Otherwise if the container is centering: justify-content: center; align-items:center
 * * 3. What's the difference between justify-content: space-between and justify-content: space-around?
 * * * Space-between evenly spaces the items in a container with even space between elements in the container whereas space-around adds even spacing on either
 side of the main axis but the space between isnt' necessarily even
